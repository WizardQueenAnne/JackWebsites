# This is a static website that doesn't require Python dependencies.
# However, if you want to serve it locally, you could use:
# 
# http-server==14.1.1  # Node.js based HTTP server (requires npm install -g http-server)
# OR
# python -m http.server  # Python's built-in server (no additional dependencies needed)
#
# For deployment platforms that require a requirements.txt file, leave this blank
# or uncomment one of the following if using a Python-based server:
#
# Flask==2.2.3
# gunicorn==20.1.0
